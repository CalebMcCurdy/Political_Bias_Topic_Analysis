During Nevada's unusual dual primary-caucus election, Nikki Haley was the only candidate on the GOP primary ballot. Despite that, she suffered a 
landslide loss
 against another option on the ballot as about two thirds of Republican voters selected "None of these candidates."

Nevada's Tuesday primary had a Democratic and a Republican ballot, but the GOP isn't awarding any delegates from the election. Instead, Nevada Republicans will hold its traditional caucuses on Thursday — where Haley will not be on the ballot.
Haley's did not spend any measurable money or resources on campaigning in Nevada, but the symbolic loss was 
quickly used against her
.
A number of Trump's supporters took to X to rub salt in Haley's wound, including former 2020 Trump campaign official Marc Lotter, who wrote: "Nikki Haley lost New Hampshire by 11% to Trump. Nikki Haley lost Nevada by 30% to LITERALLY NO ONE! Nikki Haley is losing [her] home state by 27%. How does she go on?"
