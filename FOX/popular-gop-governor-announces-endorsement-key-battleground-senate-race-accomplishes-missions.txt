Senate candidate and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy believes Democrats are spending millions in advertisements against him "to distract Montana voters from Jon Tester record."
FIRST ON FOX
: Gov. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., is endorsing former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy in the 
Montana Senate race,
 citing his "willingness to serve and sacrifice for our country."
"As a former Navy SEAL and combat veteran, Tim has proven his commitment and love for America, and he has shown his willingness to serve and sacrifice for our country," Noem said Friday in a press release obtained by Fox News Digital. "Navy SEALs are the best of the best. Not only must you be willing to serve, but you must be able to perform and execute at the highest level. That's Tim. He sets goals and accomplishes missions, which is exactly what we need more of in Washington."
Noem made the coveted endorsement just hours after Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., announced he was running in the highly competitive contest for the GOP nomination.
